R is fun and so is Data Science!
Working with data is nothing but fun!
Doing things differently, seeing data differently just makes us as Data Scientists unique!
With data, I can predict things long before they even happen, I can predict if someone is going to have an heart attack or not, or if the Doctor's medications are correct or not.....
